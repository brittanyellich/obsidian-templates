## High-level objectives to reach vision:
<!---
Determine which objectives you need to achieve over the next 3 years to make that vision a reality, and what is the process to achieve them? Break them down into smaller goals and objectives.
-->
* Goal 1
* Goal 2
* Goal 3

## 12-week plan (January 6-March 29)

<!---
Pick one or two of those objectives to work on over the course of 12 weeks. Only focus on one or two at a time.

*Write your 12-week goal and plan of achievement on paper so you can ground it in reality and refer to it when needed. Use the following criteria:** 

1. **Make your tasks specific and measurable. Your actions need to be quantified and qualified so they can be analyzed to track your progress over the 12 weeks.** 
2. **Keep your tasks positive. Write the goals in a way that promotes wins rather than losses. Rather than state, "Reduce errors by 25%," write, "Increase success rate by 75%."** 
3. **Set tasks that stretch your abilities. Challenge yourself enough to stay motivated and execute at a high level but manageable enough to not frustrate your efforts.** 
4. **Promote accountability. Take ownership of your process to ensure you follow through on the plan you've created.** 
5. **Create deadlines. Set clear deadlines for when each task needs to be completed. Deadlines motivate you to work harder and keep you accountable.**

## Peer Meeting Guidelines
* Be open and honest. This is a safe space to reflect and get feedback on your goals and progress towards them. 
* Everything shared in the meeting should be confidential.
* If you want, this group can extend beyond our current jobs and throughout our careers. The right move for all of us will be to one day leave GitHub. We don't have to stay here forever to benefit from this core group of folks working together.
* Our goals may change over time, and that's okay.
* Everyone will have different goals, and that's also okay.
* The group and the guidelines can evolve over time. If there's someone that you'd like to nominate to join us, do it! If you think we need a new guideline, let's chat about it! 
* Be present when each person is given the floor. Try to focus on that person's experience and needs, instead of focusing on what you want to talk about when you have the floor.
* **Sample agenda:**
	* 5 min. catch up
	* 5-ish min. per person to:
		* Reflect on how the last week went. 
			* Did it go well? How do you keep that up? 
			* Did it go poorly? How can you course correct?
		* Questions or concerns for the group.
			* Are you facing any challenges right now that you might want help with?
			* Are your current goals and objectives serving you?
